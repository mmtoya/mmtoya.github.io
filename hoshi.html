            <h1>Lieutenate Commander Hoshi Sato</h1>
            <p>
                Hoshi Sato is a pivotal character in the early Star Trek Enterprise series. This series happens right as
                humans are ventureing out into the unknow. Hoshi is a noted human linguist and because of her experience
                she was drafted. She is introduced as a reluctant but necessary member of
                the crew. I personally appreciate the example of her character growth throught challenging situatons.
                She emulates the struggle of overcoming fears, pushing through unknown issues, and shows personal
                growth.

            </p>
            <h2> About</h2>
            <p>
                Hoshi Sato was a noted Human linguist stationed aboard the United Earth starship Enterprise NX-01 during
                its
                historic mission of exploration. Beginning in 2151, Sato served as the ship's translator, protocol
                officer,
                and communications officer, and she was eventually responsible for the creation of the linguacode
                universal
                linguistics matrix in the following decade.
                <br> <br>
                Born in Kyoto, Japan on July 9, 2129, the second of three children, Hoshi Sato showed from an early age
                that
                she was gifted. Most of her childhood was
                spent with private tutors, learning languages. Sato did not have the opportunity to become very close to
                anyone. To her, it was often normal to spend an entire day virtually alone. This feeling of isolation
                stayed
                with Sato throughout her life; even as an adult surrounded by other people, Sato still felt alone. The
                reason she studied languages was to try to make connections to other people and cultures. The last
                person
                Sato was really close to was her grandfather, Michio Sato. When she was twelve years old,
                Sato had a pen pal from Brisbane, Australia. She loved receiving letters from her pen pal, later noting,
                "It
                was like this little window into distant places with strange-sounding names."

                When Sato was young, she often claimed her stomach was slightly unsettled as an excuse not to eat her
                grandmother's soba noodles, which she disliked. Eventually, though, it became one of her favorite foods.
                Sato was never called to the principal's office. Her mother wanted her
                to become a pianist, but Sato chose a scientific career instead. She also had a black belt
                in Aikido.
                <br> <br>

                <b>Early Career years</b>
                <br>
                After mastering a number of Earth languages, Spanish, French and German among them, Sato went to school
                to
                become an exo-linguist. She graduated second in her class and went on to spend three years at Starfleet
                Training Command. She had two training tours and had, both times, portside quarters. In her second
                month,
                Sato was discharged for breaking her company commander's arm after a dispute about a weekend poker game
                she
                organized for new recruits. Starfleet allowed her back in on probation, since they needed language
                experts.
                By the end of her training, she had been cleared for EM sidearms and Class 3 pulse rifles.
                While a university professor in Brazil, Sato and two colleagues took a hydro-skimmer to see the wildlife
                around the Amazon River but she was terrified by it. (ENT: "Fight or Flight") She taught languages at
                Amazon
                University but took a commission aboard Enterprise as communications officer in order to have the chance
                to
                experience new languages from outer space. She was initially reluctant to leave her position, but was
                convinced by Jonathan Archer to end her leave from Starfleet and join the mission. Archer tempted Sato
                with
                the realization that she would encounter numerous species and have the opportunity to discover many new
                languages.
                <br> <br>
                <b>On board Enterprise</b>
                <br>
                The reason Archer chose Sato to be part of the crew on Enterprise was due to her superior language
                skills.
                Sato was the first Human to become fluent in Klingonese, which she learned from a linguistic database
                provided by the Vulcans. Her skill in translating Klingonese came in handy during Enterprise's first
                mission
                in returning the Klingon warrior Klaang to Qo'noS and preventing the Suliban from starting a civil war.
                When
                Klaang regained consciousness aboard Enterprise en route to Qo'noS, Sato was able to obtain information
                that
                helped the mission. She also convinced Klaang that he was not among enemies, and was able to facilitate
                enough communication between the Klingons and Archer to allow them to visit Qo'noS and return Klaang.

                Hoshi's quarters aboard Enterprise were initially located on E-Deck, starboard section five. At her
                request,
                she was relocated, in a swap with Ensign Porter. Thereafter, her quarters were on
                C-Deck.

                Shortly after the beginning of the ship's mission, Sato demanded a transfer off the ship after a
                harrowing
                experience aboard an Axanar vessel: discovering the crew had been killed and drained of their fluids.
                Her
                fear of that almost overwhelmed her, and she believed that she wasn't cut out for deep space
                exploration.
                Sato was able to overcome her fears and re-board the ship to decipher the controls to send out a
                distress
                call to the victims' fellow beings. When they arrived, they began to fire on Enterprise. Sato broke the
                language barrier and communicated that Humans were not responsible for the slaughter of the Axanar. The
                two
                ships cooperated in destroying the aliens who had caused the massacre. Sato's linguistic abilities had
                established favorable relations with another new race, and she had been strengthened by the experience.

                <br> <br>
                Sato was part of an away team to the Akaali homeworld which discovered that the Malurians were secretly
                mining on a pre-industrial planet and poisoning its water supply.
                Sato's knowledge of Vulcan proved invaluable. When an away team led by T'Pol became infected by plant
                life
                on a planet, making them paranoid and dangerous to each other, she was able to tell T'Pol in Vulcan that
                an
                antidote was on its way. Sato was able to decrypt Vulcan messages that T'Pol was receiving, but left
                Commander Tucker with the language database so he could translate it himself, as she felt uncomfortable
                with
                possibly reading private information.

                Sato was in charge of monitoring other vital systems besides communications. When the Suliban Silik had
                infiltrated Enterprise disguised as a religious pilgrim, she discovered that he attempted to bypass the
                lockout codes in Shuttlepod Launch Bay One.

                Sato was given the task of finding out what Malcolm Reed's favorite food was for his birthday party. She
                was
                eventually able to learn that it was pineapple.

                Sato accompanied Archer to a planet where they found Eska hunters engaging in hunting sentient beings,
                and
                she helped protect the beings.

                Sato assisted Dr. Phlox in attempting to find a cure for the disease killing the Valakians.

                Later that year, Sato, T'Pol, and Reed became stranded on a disabled Klingon ship sinking into a gas
                giant.
                The ship was too low for Enterprise to rescue them. Sato deciphered the ship's logs, controls, and
                readouts
                so that they could get the ship running under its own power. She suggested that they fire the ship's
                weapons
                to move them to a higher orbit. This worked, and Enterprise was able to rescue them.

                The crew of Enterprise was attacked by an organism that was trying to assimilate the nervous systems of
                the
                people it entangled in its tentacles. All attempts to free them failed. Sato, using her language skills,
                was
                able to communicate with the entity, who released the crew members in return for being transported back
                to
                its home planet.
                <br> <br>
                By 2152, Sato spoke and understood between thirty-eight and forty languages.
                During shore leave on Risa, Sato met an alien named Ravis, with whom she had a romantic affair. She also
                spoke Risian, which impressed the local people.

                When Enterprise was called back for destroying a colony, they found evidence that the Cabal was to
                blame.
                They were captured by the Cabal on orders to bring Archer to their master. Though the crew was confined
                to
                their quarters, they were able to communicate with their room comm systems. The only escape was through
                the
                air vents, which were too tight for everyone to squeeze through except Sato. She made her way to Phlox's
                room, to retrieve a pair of needles, before moving on to Reed's room. Just as she arrived, her shirt
                caught
                on a hook, and was torn off, leaving her to answer Reed's door with her hands over her chest. They were
                barely able to escape from the Suliban.
                <br> <br>
                In 2152, Sato helped teach a mining colony to defend itself against Klingons. She later was injured by a
                Romulan minefield in 2152.

                Sato helped translate for the Kreetassans, who were a race very easily offended. She not only translated
                the
                language, but their customs as well. This helped Archer settle a misunderstanding between him and the
                aliens. Affected by a spatial anomaly that caused obsessive behavior in the crew, Sato was determined to
                duplicate one of her grandmother's dishes.

                During her first experience with the transporter in 2152, Sato imagined she was starting to disappear
                after
                returning to Enterprise, and that aliens were attempting to destroy the ship. While attempting to stop
                them,
                she materialized on Enterprise and discovered she had imagined it all while being caught in the pattern
                buffer for several seconds.
                <br> <br>
                In early 2153, Sato, along with Jonathan Archer and Malcolm Reed, were infected by a virus, left behind
                by
                the extinct Loque'eque race, that transformed her into a Loque'eque. She, along with Reed and Archer,
                were
                cured by Phlox.

                During contact with the Osaarians, Sato discovered a manifest. After translating it, she discovered that
                the
                race had been in a battle with the Xindi, leading Archer to interrogate the Osaarians and obtain
                valuable
                information about the Xindi.
                <br> <br>
                In October of 2153, Sato was telepathically contacted by Tarquin, an exile residing on a nearby planet.
                Tarquin told Sato that she had a unique mind, one of a few that he could connect to on a deep level. He
                tried to force her to stay with him in exchange for providing Enterprise with information on the Xindi,
                but
                Sato refused, despite his claims that he understood her loneliness better than anyone ever could.
                Tarquin
                later provided information on the Xindi.

                Sato helped take the ship back after Archer, infected by Xindi toxin, endangered the mission. She
                discovered
                that the pod Archer was returned in after the battle of Azati Prime contained a message that Degra,
                leader
                of the Xindi-Primates, wished to meet with Archer.
                <br> <br>
                In February 2154, Sato was kidnapped by Commander Dolim. Using Xindi neural parasites, she was compelled
                to
                assist the Xindi-Reptilians in decrypting the Xindi-Aquatic activation codes for the Xindi weapon. Sato
                fought bravely against them, scrambling the codes further and even attempting to kill herself to prevent
                them from gaining access to the codes. The Xindi-Reptilians eventually forced her to comply and she
                decrypted the codes, but was subsequently rescued by a team of MACOs led by Major Hayes. Although Sato
                was
                still suffering from the effects of the parasites, Archer insisted that she accompany his team in their
                attempt to destroy the weapon. Sato was successful in decrypting the schematics for the weapon, allowing
                Archer to successfully destroy it from within.
                <br> <br>
                The return home
                <br>
                Some months after Enterprise's return to Earth, Sato was infected with a silicon-based virus while part
                of a
                landing party on a planet's surface, looking for salvage among Klingon waste. While quarantined in the
                decontamination chamber and in a delirious state, she displayed skill in decrypting the locking sequence
                for
                doors on the entire deck, causing a ship-wide quarantine breach alert. Although Sato initially died due
                to
                the virus, she was cured by two Organian observers, who were watching the crew's reaction to the virus.


                Sato participated in Enterprise's effort to capture Augments whose action threatened the peace between
                Earth
                and the Klingons. Also, she served during the Vulcan Reformation and the Klingon Augment Crisis.
                <br> <br>
                In January of 2155, Sato was responsible for improvements made to the universal translator. During the
                Terra
                Prime crisis, Captain Archer left her in command of Enterprise, fondly recalling when she used to jump
                every
                time the engines hiccuped. Hoshi replied that she still did, she had just gotten better at hiding it.
                While
                the rest of the senior staff were rescuing Trip Tucker and T'Pol from the surface of Mars, Sato
                disobeyed
                orders from Nathan Samuels to destroy the array after the deadline for all non-Humans to leave the Sol
                system had passed, despite her orders left by Archer to destroy the verteron array if his team could not
                stop it from firing on San Francisco, hoping Archer would stop Terra Prime in time; going as far as to
                prevent Samuels from contacting Admiral Gardner. Luckily, Tucker managed to alter the target so the
                array
                fired into the ocean, just as Sato was about to open fire.

                Sato was still serving aboard Enterprise with the rank of ensign when the ship was decommissioned in
                2161.
                After the ship's final mission to rescue Talla, the daughter of the Andorian Shran, and following the
                death
                of her crewmate, Commander Charles Tucker III, she attended the historic founding ceremony of the United
                Federation of Planets in San Francisco. Sato presumably returned to Brazil a few weeks after the
                ceremony,
                as she told Travis Mayweather.

                Following the signing of the Federation Charter, Sato went on to serve in the Federation Starfleet for a
                time. She retired from Starfleet with the rank of Lieutenant Commander, sometime in the mid-2160s, and
                went
                on to develop the linguacode translation matrix. By the end of her
                career, she was known to speak 86 languages.

                Sato was married at some point and died prior to 2268.
