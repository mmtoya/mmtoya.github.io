        <h1>Admiral Kathryn Janeway</h1>
        <p>
            Kathryn Janeway was intoduced to me as the first Captain of the USS Voyager. She was the first female
            Captain to be a main character. I love seeing her in this role because she embodies what it means to be a
            strong yet compassionate leader. She always leads through example and holds herself to the same standard she
            would expect from anyone else. She also has the compassion to see people where they are and give them the
            space and encouragement to grow.
            <br> Janeway reminds me that it is important to always be curious, live up to my full potential, share
            knowledge and learn from others, and always stand up for what I know is right.
            <br>
            I will always love Captain Kathryn Janeway for the role model she is to all women.

        </p>
        <h2>
            About
        </h2>

        <p>
            Kathryn Margaret Janeway is a Human woman in Starfleet during the 24th century. In 2371, she assumed command
            of the Federation starship USS Voyager, which was shortly thereafter pulled into the Delta Quadrant. She
            managed to bring the ship and crew back to the Alpha Quadrant by December 2377, and was thereafter promoted
            from captain to admiral.
            <br>
            <br>
            Kathryn, daughter of Edward and Gretchen Janeway, was born on May 20, 2336 in Bloomington, Indiana.
            Kathryn's younger sister, Phoebe Janeway, was born four years later.

            As a young child, she was given the nickname "Goldenbird" by her parents. Kathryn was also particularly
            close to her father. He got his daughter interested in mathematics and science. She still found time for fun
            as a child and often enjoyed the Trevis and Flotter holodeck programs, including one time when she flooded
            an entire holodeck.

            At the age of 9, Kathryn was treated to her first trip off Earth to the Mars Colonies. Her father took her
            from San Francisco via shuttlecraft to Utopia Planitia where they toured the colonies with Cadet Data. This
            was the first of many adventures that Kathryn took with her father. She also hiked the Grand Canyon's North
            rim with her father as a child.

            Kathryn later began attending The Meadows, and soon became the tennis captain of her team at the school.
            Despite being a tennis pro, Kathryn also enjoyed swimming. While swimming on Mars under Olympus Mons, she
            saved the life of Mark Hobbes Johnson after he became trapped in an undercurrent. Despite her brave actions,
            she was grounded by her father.

            While a senior at the Academy Institute, Janeway was dating Cheb Parker. One night, the pair snuck into
            Magruder Mansion in Ohio, and discovered a deranged old woman living in the mansion. On their return to the
            Institute, they were severely reprimanded for the incident.

            <br>
            <br>
            Janeway was accepted into Starfleet Academy in 2353 at the age of 18. While at the Academy, her roommate was
            Lettie Garrett. She also roomed with Thrum and Pol for a time, who were collectively known as Thrum'Pol.
            While her time at the Academy was mainly a happy one, Janeway was often bullied by Wendy Kerrigan, a
            professor at the Academy. She was also a star student of Admiral Hendricks.
            Upon entering her third year at the Academy, Cadet Janeway was interviewed by Admiral Owen Paris, in regards
            to being her adviser in the writing of her junior honor thesis. Paris initially tried to turn her down since
            he, as a rule, normally only worked with seniors but Janeway persisted. Eventually Paris agreed, but warned
            her that he was a tough taskmaster and he expected only the best, something Janeway consistently provided.
            With his assistance, she wrote a brilliant thesis but had to turn down a date with Cadet William T. Riker in
            the process. The following year, Janeway completed her doctoral degree in quantum cosmology.

            While at the Academy, Janeway began a relationship with Lieutenant Justin Tighe, and the two were soon
            engaged to be married.
            <br>
            <br>
            Ensign Janeway graduated from the Academy and was assigned to Admiral Paris' staff in San Francisco in 2357.
            At Paris' request, Janeway assisted civilian adviser Kyle Riker uncover the involvement of Vice-Admiral
            Horace Bonner in the Tholian attack on Starbase 311 in 2353, as well as several attempts on Riker's life.

            Tired of sitting behind a desk, Admiral Paris made the decision to get back into the game and arranged to be
            in command of the USS Al-Batani for the year-long Arias expedition. Admiral Paris asked Janeway to join his
            crew as junior science officer.

            The novel Mosaic states that Janeway's first posting was aboard the USS Icarus, however, all canon sources
            stated that her first posting was the Al-Batani.Six months into the Arias Expedition, Admiral Paris and
            Janeway were in a shuttlecraft orbiting Utrea II, when they were captured and tortured by the Cardassian,
            Gul Camet. The two officers were rescued by Lt. Tighe, whose life was in turn saved by Janeway. As a result,
            Paris recommended that Janeway switch from science division to command division.
            <br>
            <br>
            In 2358, Janeway lost both her fianc√© and father while they were testing the prototype ship Terra Nova on
            Tau Ceti Prime. While making a final approach for landing, the ship crash landed on Tau Ceti into a polar
            icecap. While Kathryn survived the crash, the others were frozen to death. She was rescued and took a leave
            of absence to deal with her deep depression.
            <br>
            <br>
            In 2359, Janeway returned to active duty and announced her intention to switch to the command division at
            Starfleet Headquarters. At the arrangement of Admiral Paris, Janeway spent six months on an Earth-bound
            assignment before being assigned a deep-space mission. While on Earth, she started to become closer to Mark
            Johnson.
            <br>
            <br>
            By late 2359, Janeway was second officer aboard the USS Mary Kingsley, under the command of Captain Onna
            Karapleedeez. During their mission surveying the Scorpius Reach in Beta Quadrant, they assisted a civilian
            research vessel, the Cleopatra's Needle. One of the researchers Janeway worked with was Jean-Luc Picard, who
            had taken a leave of absence following his loss of the USS Stargazer.
            <br>
            <br>
            In 2363, Captain Janeway assumed command of the USS Billings. The Billings was her first proper command, and
            she often felt deeply responsible for her actions and the effects on her crew. Following one away team
            mission, she felt deeply responsible for the loss of Ensign Yvonne Harper's legs, unborn child, and sanity.

            While choosing key personnel to serve under him on the USS Enterprise-D, Captain Jean-Luc Picard was
            disappointed that Janeway was no longer available as a candidate for first officer.
            <br>
            <br>

            In 2365, the now Captain Janeway was in command of the USS Bonestell on a six-month exploratory mission of
            the Beta Quadrant. Following the mission, Janeway went before a review board consisting of Admiral Paris,
            Admiral McGeorge Finnegan, and Admiral Alynna Nechayev. Her close friend Ensign Tuvok was called in to
            criticize Janeway's ignorance of tactical regulations on the mission, and it was recommended by Admiral
            Finnegan that Tuvok serve under Janeway on her next deep-space mission. Janeway and Tuvok were still serving
            together on the Bonestell when Janeway asked Tuvok to transfer with her to Voyager.

            <br>
            <br>
            Shakedown
            In late 2370, Captain Janeway was offered the position of commanding officer of the USS Voyager still under
            construction at the Utopia Planitia Fleet Yards. As a result she buried herself in all the technical manuals
            concerning Voyager, and by the time she was given a guided tour by Admiral Theoderich Patterson in early
            2371, she was proficient at every inch of the starship.
            <br>
            Janeway officially assumed command of Voyager on stardate 48038.5, and took the starship out on its
            shakedown cruises. The cruise was to proceed to the border of the Demilitarized Zone near the Badlands to
            test out Voyager's bio-neural circuitry. On the first test of the systems, the gel packs malfunctioned and
            Voyager was left drifting in space. Thankfully, the USS Hood, under Captain Robert DeSoto, came to Voyager's
            aid.
            <br>
            After repairs were completed, both starships were alerted to the detection of one of the Malkus Artifacts
            under General Order 16, and discovered that it was found by the Maquis. Janeway sent her tactical officer,
            Lieutenant Tuvok, undercover to obtain the artifact from the Maquis. Tuvok's mission was successful and the
            artifact was rescued by the Hood. It was also decided that Tuvok would remain undercover with the Maquis.
            (VOY - The Brave and the Bold, Book Two novella: The Third Artifact)
            <br>
            <br>
            In the Delta Quadrant
            2371
            Captain Kathryn Janeway in 2371.

            When Tuvok failed to report in, Janeway decided to go after him. Janeway went to the New Zealand Penal
            Settlement to recruit a cashiered Starfleet officer, Tom Paris - a former Maquis member - to help find the
            Maquis ship and her chief of security in exchange for her help at Paris' next review.

            Janeway then rendezvoused with Voyager at Deep Space 9 and then went into the Badlands. As Janeway and the
            Voyager crew searched the Badlands, they were then engulfed by a displacement wave that took them seventy
            thousand light-years into the farthest corner of the galaxy, the Delta Quadrant. There, Janeway discovered
            that a entity called the Caretaker had brought both Voyager and the Maquis ship Val Jean to help him search
            for a suitable mate in which to procreate offspring to take his place as caretaker of a species called the
            Ocampa. Following the rescue of Kim and Torres, Janeway was forced to destroy the Caretaker's array to
            protect the Ocampa from the Kazon. She then invited the Maquis to join her crew, installing Chakotay as her
            First officer. She also accepted trader Neelix and his companion Kes. (VOY episode & novelization:
            Caretaker)
            <br> <br>
            2372
            Janeway then responded to a distress signal from Talaxian Captain Acrux's ship stuck in a ion storm. She was
            then able to use the transporters to beam Acrux' crew aboard, but they were pulled into a quantum fissure's
            dimensional plane. Janeway then gave Chakotay and Neelix bands that to help them return. However, Janeway
            became duplicitous when she thought about how the Talaxians got themselves into the situation. She and Tuvok
            then found out that they were Trabe agents trying to steal their technology. She then investigated energy
            spikes that took The Doctor and merged her holo-novel and the Beowulf holo-novel. Following that incident
            Janeway was then taken hostage by Acrux and his mercenaries as Trabe Captain Nagrom's ship attacked. However
            she was able to subdue them and fight off the Trabe ship.

            Following that incident, Janeway was forced to look for duranium when Voyager was running low on supplies.
            Janeway was forced to set the phasers to 1/100 power to disable a Kazon raider. Janeway then asked Neelix
            where the nearest supply of duranium, which was Praja. However, Janeway was told by the Doctor that a
            botanical plague had devastated. Despite that, she allowed Neelix and an away team to investigate the
            planet. She continued to hail the planet without little success. She the Doctor, Kim and Kes then examined
            the virus that poisoned the planet and found that it was not native to Praja. Janeway refused to mine the
            Duranium with the colonists consent despite Torres' objections. However, Janeway was able to come an
            arrangement with the Cambrog survivors to mine Duranium in exchange for emergency rations, supplies and to
            help eliminate the plague. Janeway and Voyager then came under attack by Kazon-Oglamar mining ships. Janeway
            then used Lt. Paris' idea to trick the Kazon into believing that they were crashing. Janeway was able to get
            the duranium for the phasers and force the Kazon to withdraw. Afterwards, Janeway had the planet sprayed
            with healthy bacteria that would heal the planet.
            <br> <br>
            2373-2374
            Janeway then had Paris and Kim taken to the brig when they started a brawl in the mess hall. Janeway then
            led an away team to Denar. There she and the away team were attacked by a creature. Following that
            encounter, Janeway then met Bonai, who sent sent Tuvok and the rest of the away team back to Voyager.
            Janeway was then forced to help him to prevent the Vidiians, Kazon and Trabe from getting a powerful
            artifact. She was forced to work with the 3 representatives of each species to find the artifact. She helped
            the Vidiian Dr. Teraz and saved Kul'Lar from a ape-like creature. Janeway and Teraz were then able to defeat
            with a scalding weapon. Janeway and the three others then found the artifact. After Kul'Lar and Durin wer
            destroyed by the artifact, Janeway and Teraz found the artifact. However, she refused to accept Bonai's gift
            to take Voyager back to the Alpha Quadrant.

            A month later, Janeway responded to a distress signal from a Zerajhan professor K'Them K'Tra who was stuck
            in a Dead Zone. However, Janeway and Voyager then came under attack by Overseer Reega Mohl's Raft Cabal when
            she refused to join him. Janeway and her crew then fought against the Cabal's boarders. Luckily, Janeway was
            to use Tuvok's plan to use a torpedo to free themselves from the Deadzone. She then took professor K'Tra and
            Mohl's renegades to Zerajh to stand trial.

            Janeway then encountered a chroniton wave that took Voyager to the Battle of Wolf 359 six years earlier. As
            they made they way back through anomaly, they beamed several escape pod survivors onboard. Unfortunately,
            she was forced to send them back into the anomaly.

            Following Janeway's brief alliance with the Borg, she took on Seven of Nine as part of her crew. Janeway and
            Voyager then came under attack by a alien known as the Prospector and his drones from an ocean-wide planet.
            <br> <br>

            2375
            In 2375, Voyager discovered another Federation ship lost in the Delta Quadrant, the USS Equinox, captained
            by Rudolph Ransom. The away team to the Equinox was led by Captain Janeway. Ransom explained that his ship
            was attacked by creatures that killed much of his crew. The crew was beamed to Voyager for medical attention
            and the Voyager crew attempted to repair the Equinox. Janeway discovered that the reason the creatures were
            attacking the Equinox was that Ransom had been capturing them and using them for fuel for the ship. Janeway
            confronted Ransom and arrested him and his crew. The EMH for the Equinox, which was beamed aboard Voyager
            helped the crew escape back to the Equinox. They disabled Voyager, kidnapped Seven and sped away. In the
            meantime, the creatures attacked Voyager.
            <br> <br>

            2376
            When Voyager found the Equinox, a battle ensued. When the Equinox was damaged by Voyager and attacked by the
            creatures, Ransom had a change of heart, dropped his shields and surrendered Seven in exchange for his crew
            beaming aboard Voyager.

            Ransom himself stayed with his ship as it exploded. Janeway's final words to Ransom was her promise to get
            his crew home. Satisfied with the Equinox' destruction, the aliens ceased their attacks on Voyager. The five
            surviving Equinox crew members, Marla Gilmore, Noah Lessing, James Morrow, Angelo Tassoni, and Brian Sofin,
            were stripped of rank and ordered to serve as crewmen on Voyager, with extensive supervision and limited
            privileges.

            Janeway then entrusted Seven of Nine with finding out if the attackers in a debris field were Borg or not.
            Janeway then assisted Hazard team in defeating the Tarlus and the Vohrsoth. She then promoted Alexander
            Munro to Lieutenant.
            <br> <br>

            2377
            After seven years in the Delta Quadrant, Janeway was able to get Voyager and its crew home thanks to help
            from her future counterpart, Admiral Janeway.
            <br> <br>
            Admiral Janeway
            Admiral Janeway 2381
            Vice Admiral Kathryn Janeway in 2381.

            Janeway was promoted shortly after her return to Earth in 2378. In 2379, she sent Captain Picard and the USS
            Enterprise-E to Romulus at the request of newly installed Praetor Shinzon of Remus. She later attended the
            christening of the USS Protostar with her former First officer, Captain Chakotay.

            Search for Chakotay
            Janeway was then given command of the USS Dauntless and returned the edge of the Delta Quadrant. She and the
            Dauntless' crew searched for the Protostar, it's crew and captain Chakotay.

            The Needs of the Many
            By the year 2409, Janeway's death was not remembered as part of Jake Sisko's study of history, as was noted
            in an interview with DTI agents Marion Dulmur and Gariff Lucsly. In the course of the discussion, the
            agents' concerns over the integrity of the timeline was brought about in discussions of the fact that they
            remembered a different version of history.

            Admiral Janeway was remembered by Jake and others as surviving the Long War-era into the 25th century.
            Previously, she had been the commanding officer of Starfleet's response to the Hobus supernova in 2387.
