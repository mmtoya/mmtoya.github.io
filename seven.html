            <h1>Captain Seven of Nine</h1>
            <p>


            </p>
            <p>
                Annika was born in 2344, on stardate 25479, at the Tendara colony as the only daughter of eccentric
                Federation exobiologists Magnus and Erin Hansen.
                During her childhood, she never visited Earth. Her favorite color growing up was red.
                She wanted to grow up to be a ballerina.
                Annika once stayed with her Aunt Irene. Her favorite treats were strawberry tarts, which Irene used to
                coax Annika out of a guest room in which she had locked herself. She was very strong-willed and did not
                hesitate to point out if the strawberries used in baking the tarts were not perfectly ripe.Annika's
                parents were exobiologists investigating the existence of the Borg. After a great deal of persuasion,
                the Federation granted the Hansens the use of the USS Raven, a small long-range craft, to aid them in
                their investigation.

                During the late 2340s, they took Annika, then aged four, along with them. They spent a good deal of time
                aboard the Raven in search of the Borg. One memorable event Annika shared aboard
                the vessel during their three year trek was the celebration of her sixth birthday: her birthday cake, at
                the time, had six candles, with one to grow on.

                At some point, the Hansens encountered a Borg cube and followed it through its transwarp conduit into
                the Delta Quadrant, the Borg's region of origin. They gathered a great deal of scientific data on the
                biology of Borg drones and the nature of the Collective by moving undetected through Borg space due to
                multi-adaptive shielding, invented by Magnus Hansen. They even went aboard Borg vessels, using
                bio-dampeners to remain undetected.

                Their research came to an abrupt end in 2350 when an ion storm struck the Raven. The ship sustained
                damage, including, most importantly, damage to the multi-adaptive shielding, which went off-line for
                13.2 seconds. This left them exposed long enough for the Borg to detect them and perceive them as a
                target for assimilation. The Hansens tried to evade pursuit by masking the Raven's warp trail, but the
                Borg still managed to pursue and find them.

                They and their daughter were promptly captured and assimilated near B'omar space. Naturally, the
                experience was traumatizing for the six-year old; decades later, the memory of being injected with
                stabilizing metals so the body could handle nanoprobes would cause her to recall the smell and taste of
                them, taking her back to the horror of that moment.
                <br> <br>
                Life as a Borg drone
                <br>

                Annika was placed in a maturation chamber, where the hive mind began to restructure her synaptic
                pathways and purge her individuality. She emerged as a Borg drone five years later in 2355, the turmoil
                of her forcible assimilation replaced with order, and spent the next eighteen years in the Collective
                with the designation: Seven of Nine, Tertiary Adjunct of Unimatrix 01.

                As a drone, she assisted in the assimilation of millions, from individuals to entire species. She
                personally assimilated many individuals from a variety of species, including Humans, Klingons, Ferengi,
                Bajorans, Bolians, Krenim, and Cardassians.

                In early 2368, the Borg sphere that Seven of Nine, along with three other drones in her unimatrix, crash
                landed on a planet in the Delta Quadrant. The other drones, who were assimilated as adults, began to
                regain their identities upon being severed from the Borg Collective, but Seven was frightened as she
                knew nothing else but life as a drone. She forcibly linked the other drones together into a temporary
                collective in order to suppress their identities, and they were retrieved soon after. Seven of Nine
                remained a Borg drone until 2374, when she was liberated

                Scientific accomplishments
                <br>
                During her first few months on Voyager, Seven attempted to help the engineering crew modify the warp
                drive to generate transwarp conduits. The efforts failed, and almost cost Voyager its warp core in the
                process.

                Along with Ensign Harry Kim, Seven of Nine designed and constructed the ship's astrometrics lab, which
                used Borg technology to plot routes that trimmed several years off of Voyager's journey. The lab became
                an important asset to Voyager and was Seven's domain for the rest of the journey. Using the astrometrics
                lab, Seven discovered the Hirogen communications network, which allowed Voyager to temporarily receive
                messages from the Alpha Quadrant. When monthly data streams and, later, real-time communication became
                possible, Seven helped implement enhancements to Voyager's deflector dish.

                Seven developed a technique for using Borg nanoprobes to revive an individual who had been dead several
                hours. It was used on Neelix in 2374.

                A team led by Seven adapted a Borg design to contain and destroy Omega molecules found in the Delta
                Quadrant in 2374. The molecules temporarily stabilized while in the chamber. Seven was the only one to
                see it happen; as the Borg considered the Omega Molecule to be "perfection" in its purest form , the
                former drone underwent what could be described as a religious
                experience when she saw Omega spontaneously stabilize.

                Seven was part of the team which designed and built the Delta Flyer shuttlecraft in 2375. She developed
                Borg-based technology and weapons for it.

                Seven assisted in the construction of the quantum slipstream drive installed aboard Voyager in 2375. In
                an alternate timeline, the use of the drive destroyed the ship, killing her and everyone else aboard.
                However, just after the drive was activated, a signal from that timeline was received by Seven via her
                cortical implants. This signal contained phase corrections that, when used, collapsed the slipstream,
                eliminating that timeline and saving the ship and crew.

                When Voyager crossed the territory of the anti-telepathic Devore in 2375, Seven helped develop a
                transporter suspension technique in order to hide telepathic crewmembers and Brenari refugees. (VOY:
                "Counterpoint")

                She also gave Voyager the possibility to use a transwarp coil, which was then used to save her from the
                Borg and then to advance twenty thousand light years towards home.
                In 2376, Seven developed enhancements to her alcove that allowed her to process information and make
                connections between various events while she regenerated. This allowed Seven to deduce that photonic
                fleas had been degrading sensor efficiency and that a catapult built by an alien named Tash employed a
                tetryon reactor like that of the Caretaker's array. However, the process overloaded her cortical
                implants, and she began drawing wild conclusions concerning Voyager's mission and crew. She convinced
                Chakotay that Voyager's presence in the Delta Quadrant was intentional and a prelude to a joint
                Federation/Cardassian invasion, while later telling Captain Janeway that Chakotay was organizing a
                Maquis rebellion, using technology of the Caretaker, to launch strikes on Federation and Cardassian
                targets. She then began to believe that Voyager was sent to the Delta Quadrant to retrieve her from the
                Borg Collective, and that she would be analyzed and dissected upon return to the Alpha Quadrant. She
                left the ship in the Delta Flyer, but Janeway was able to convince her that this 'conspiracy' was only a
                delusion caused by her alcove enhancements. She returned to Voyager and the enhancements were removed.

                A hologram of Reginald Barclay was transmitted to Voyager in early 2377. The hologram supposedly brought
                information to Voyager about using a geodesic fold to return the ship to the Alpha Quadrant. In reality,
                the hologram had been intercepted and reprogrammed by Ferengi, who wanted to harvest Seven of Nine's
                nanoprobes and sell them for profit. Although the holo-Barclay claimed modifications to the shields
                would protect Voyager while in the fold, Seven eventually discovered that the hologram was deceiving
                them.

                Seven and Chakotay made first contact with the Ventu on Ledos before the start of a conference on that
                planet. Initially hesitant to reach out to the primitive race, Seven was so moved by her experiences
                with the Ventu that she convinced Janeway to restore the energy barrier protecting the Ventu's lands and
                customs from the Ledosians.

                <br> <br>
                Moral conflicts
                <br>
                Voyager rescued a member of Species 8472 from a Hirogen hunting party in mid 2374. Captain Janeway
                wanted to return the creature to its native fluidic space because it had told Tuvok of its plight
                telepathically; it meant no harm and just wanted to go home. The Hirogen, however, wanted to hunt and
                kill it. They threatened to destroy Voyager unless the 8472 was returned to them. Seven felt that it
                should be surrendered in order to protect Voyager, but Captain Janeway strongly disagreed, saying that
                it was wrong to sacrifice another lifeform to save themselves. Seven refused to help open a quantum
                singularity into fluidic space to allow the 8472 to return to its realm, and Janeway confined her to the
                cargo bay. The Doctor needed nanoprobes to help treat the injured alien, and Seven was ordered to bring
                them to The Doctor so he could treat it. At the same time, a Hirogen hunter who had been injured from
                his initial hunt of the 8472, and who The Doctor had been treating, attacked the 8472. Seven transported
                both the Hirogen and the Species 8472 to a Hirogen vessel, which then retreated. Janeway was not happy
                with Seven's conduct, and revoked most of her privileges until she proved trustworthy once again. Seven
                believed she was being punished for asserting her individuality and her personal beliefs, which the
                Voyager crew had fostered since she had been freed from the Collective.

                Voyager encountered Entharan weapons broker Kovin in 2374. Seven worked with him and viewed the weapons
                he offered to sell, but was very much uncomfortable around him. She later struck him in engineering.
                With The Doctor's help, Seven recovered memories which suggested Kovin had assaulted her and stolen
                nanoprobes for use as weapons. Circumstantial evidence also supported her story, and Voyager tried to
                apprehend Kovin. It is later determined that her memories were simply ones from her time as a Borg drone
                mixed with experiences of Kovin. Unfortunately, Kovin was killed when Voyager tried to contact him and
                tell him of his innocence. Both Seven and The Doctor experienced deep remorse over contributing to
                Kovin's death.



                When the Omega particles were found in the Delta Quadrant, Seven held a certain fascination with them,
                since the Borg had tried, unsuccessfully, to stabilize the molecules. She believed they held the key to
                perfection and that she would be able to use the Borg research to stabilize the molecules. However,
                Captain Janeway believed it was too risky and the molecules were destroyed. They spontaneously
                stabilized shortly before being destroyed by Voyager. Seven witnessed this and experienced one of her
                first spiritual moments in the process.

                A race of bounty hunters known as the Hazari began attacking Voyager in 2375. A group of aliens called
                the Think Tank offered to help Voyager defeat the Hazari, but wanted Seven of Nine as payment. Kurros, a
                member of the Think Tank, tried to appeal to Seven's quest for perfection and have her join willingly,
                but she declined his offer. Further investigation revealed that Kurros had hired the Hazari to attack
                Voyager for the express purpose of taking Seven of Nine. The crew developed a plan with the Hazari which
                involved Seven willingly joining the Think Tank. Once with them, she would disable systems aboard their
                vessel. Kurros sensed deception, and forced Seven to link with the Think Tank's telepathic net. She
                overloaded the network as the link was established, disrupting the function of their entire ship. Seven
                was returned to Voyager as the Think Tank was overwhelmed with a Hazari attack squadron.

                In 2376, Voyager docked at a Markonian outpost. While there, Seven of Nine encountered the group of
                drones which she had linked together eight years prior. They had since been liberated from the
                Collective, but were permanently linked due to Seven's modifications. They attacked Seven in order to
                find out what she had done to them, but were stopped by Voyager security. Seven later voluntarily linked
                with the drones to retrieve the memories of the crash, but further damage was caused when the link was
                broken. Even though the drones were no longer connected to one another, all but Seven were left
                comatose. They needed their neural implants removed, but it would only give them a month to live. They
                could be saved if reassimilated into the Borg Collective, but Seven decided that a brief life as an
                individual was much more valuable than eternal life as a drone, and she ordered The Doctor to remove the
                implants. The former drones were still upset about the decision made by Seven eight years prior, but
                understood her reasons and were grateful for their new-found freedom, however short.

                Also that year, Seven was part of an away team which discovered the Vaadwaur race, placed in stasis
                centuries prior. Seven was excited at the prospect of helping to rebuild a society in order to atone for
                the destruction she participated in while a member of the Collective, and worked with the Vaadwaur to
                find them a new home. It was later determined that the Vaadwaur were warlike and hostile, and their
                awakening placed the region of space near their homeworld in great danger. Seven was upset that her
                intention to help may have caused further suffering.

                Again during the same year, Seven and an injured Tuvok were captured by Penk, a Norcadian who organized
                the spectator sport Tsunkatse, and Seven was forced to fight in the ring. After rescue, Tuvok thanked
                her for taking his place in a red match and asked if she had recovered. Seven said that her victory only
                came from her loss of control, and worried that the three years she had spent regaining her Humanity
                were lost in the ring. However, Tuvok pointed out that her feelings of guilt, shame and remorse meant
                that her Humanity had been reaffirmed, not lost.


                In 2377, Seven became friends with a Nygean man named Iko, who had committed murder and had been
                sentenced to death on his homeworld. Initially, Iko took Seven prisoner when he was beamed aboard
                Voyager and made threats to the crew. He later became remorseful when his body and conscience were
                "healed" by Seven's nanoprobes after he was severely beaten by Yediq, the prison warden, when he
                threatened his family. Seven tried to help him avoid his death sentence, but his crime could not be
                forgiven by the victim's family and he was put to death. Seven was left troubled at the idea that Iko
                was executed for one murder while she had never been punished for her own actions in the Borg, but
                Janeway assured her that her time in the Collective was punishment enough.
                <br> <br>
                Dealings with the Borg
                <br>
                While transporting back to Voyager in 2375, a malfunction caused nanoprobes from Seven's bloodstream to
                merge with The Doctor's mobile emitter. The nanoprobes quickly assimilated the advanced 29th century
                technology, and used genetic material from Mulchaey to create an advanced Borg drone, with the emitter
                at its core. The drone lacked Borg programming, giving Seven the opportunity to communicate with him.
                She attempted to teach him to be an individual, and he was even given the name One by Neelix, but he
                wished to learn more about the Borg. Attempts to prevent the Borg from detecting One failed and his
                attempts to modify Voyager's weapons to fight them proved insufficient. He transported aboard the Borg
                vessel, destroying it from within. His built-in shielding allowed him to survive the explosion badly
                injured, but he refused treatment and died in Voyager's sickbay to keep the crew safe from constant
                assimilation threats. Seven mourned him as if she had lost a son.


                Later in 2375, Voyager's crew prepared for a daring raid on a damaged Borg sphere in order to steal a
                transwarp coil and substantially shorten their journey home. Seven was contacted by the Borg Queen, who
                revealed that she had set a trap for Voyager and its crew would be assimilated if she did not return to
                the Collective. Seven reluctantly agreed, learning that she was deliberately granted her freedom as part
                of a larger plan to assimilate Humanity. Seven resisted the Queen's attempts to convince her to develop
                a nanoprobe virus and was eventually rescued by Voyager's crew.

                In 2377 she discovered that she was one of a few Borg with a certain assimilation mutation that allowed
                them to retain their individuality while regenerating inside of an artificial construct known as
                Unimatrix Zero. Freed from the Collective, she was once again contacted by the others inside. They were
                on the verge of being discovered and needed her help. With some assistance from Voyager's crew, the
                drones were given the ability to retain their individuality outside of the construct. This allowed them
                to launch an open revolt against the Collective, plunging the Collective into civil war.
                <br> <br>
                Identity crises
                <br>
                When the Hirogen overtook Voyager in 2374 and used its crew and holodecks to conduct hunts, Seven was
                assigned the identity of Mademoiselle de Neuf in the French Resistance holoprogram. The Doctor was able
                to modify her Borg implants and restore her real identity without the Hirogen knowing. She worked with
                The Doctor and Ensign Kim to stage a counterstrike against the Hirogen and restore the identities of the
                rest of the crew. Seven later modified explosives to emit a photonic burst which disabled holographic
                activity on part of the ship, a crucial event which allowed Captain Janeway to defeat the leader of the
                Hirogen and return control of the ship to the Starfleet crew.



                Seven was stricken with something akin to a multiple-personality disorder in 2375 when Voyager neared a
                vinculum infected with a synthetic pathogen by Species 6339. Several personalities, including Starfleet
                officers, a Klingon warrior, a Vulcan official, a Krenim scientist, a Ferengi trader, a woman trying to
                find her son aboard the USS Melbourne at the Battle of Wolf 359, and a frightened young child, emerged.
                These turned out to be personalities of individuals assimilated by the Borg, and it was soon made clear
                the malfunctions in her implants were precisely what Species 6339 wished to inflict on the rest of the
                Collective. The personalities began to take over Seven, and her own individuality was lost. Tuvok was
                able to use a mind meld to retrieve Seven's consciousness and the vinculum was deactivated.

                In 2377, Voyager's crew was forced to abandon ship after hitting a subspace mine. They were rescued by
                rogue elements of the Quarren, and had their identities reassigned in order to supply labor and fill a
                shortage on the Quarren homeworld. The entire crew, except Chakotay, Kim, and Neelix, who were away on
                the Delta Flyer, had their memories of Voyager erased and false memories of terrible conditions on their
                homeworlds implanted. Seven started to use her real name, Annika Hansen, and was given a job as an
                efficiency monitor in a power distribution plant, working with several other Voyager crew members
                including Captain Janeway, Tuvok, and B'Elanna Torres. Her Borg desire for perfection made her perfectly
                suited for the job, and she was often overzealous in chastising workers. The identity reassignment did
                not completely work on Tuvok, though, and he began to remember his former life, including Seven of Nine.
                He mind-melded with her, causing memories of her life on Voyager and as a drone to resurface. As the
                flashbacks continued, Annika investigated Tuvok's records. She believed there was a connection to the
                disappearance of Torres, who had been rescued by the remaining Voyager crew, and Annika later learned
                that Tuvok had accessed files of most of the Voyager crew, including Janeway, Torres, and herself. This
                led her to realize the inconsistency that many new workers from the same species began work on the same
                day, which was unusual during a labor shortage. Additionally, they were all brought through the
                neuropathology division, although none of the workers remembered this. Her suspicions were dismissed and
                explained as an outbreak of Dysphoria Syndrome. Annika was undaunted, and later visited the
                neuropathology division complaining of the flashbacks in order to access their computer system. While
                there, she discovered the Dysphoria Syndrome outbreak was actually a cover-up masterminded by a Quarren
                doctor called Kadan, to hide the fact that Voyager's crew and many others had been abducted. This
                confirmed the story Chakotay had told to Captain Janeway, and Annika and a Quarren official, Yerid, went
                to the hospital to prevent Kadan from using the reassignment technique on Chakotay and Tuvok. They
                succeeded, and the entire Voyager crew was transported back to the ship. The Doctor was successful in
                restoring the identities of the entire crew.
